# Multicurve SABR-FMM

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Forward Market Model (FMM)** with **SABR Stochastic Volatility** as per Lyashenko, Mercurio (2019). It features a pricer for **Bermudan Swaptions** using Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM).

## Features

* **SABR Stochastic Volatility:** Each forward rate follows a (Normal) SABR process with $\beta = 0$. The model includes a calibration engine using Hagan's Normal Volatility expansion.

* **Drift :** Implements the drift adjustments required for FMM with stochastic volatility, as in Mercurio 2009.

* **Correlation Matrix:** Handles a $4N \times 4N$ matrix covering Rate-Rate, Vol-Vol, Skew, and Cross-Curve correlations. Supports PCA and parametric correlations (Exponential Decay or Two-Parameters).

* **Calibration** is performed against swaptions market normal volatility using Hagan's Normal Volatility approximation. The optimizer minimizes the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) between model-implied and market volatilities for each tenor slice.
  
* **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
  * **Sobol Sequences:** For faster Quasi-Monte Carlo convergence.
  * **Brownian Bridges:** To construct effective path trajectories.
  * **Predictor-Corrector:** For time-dependent Drift adjustment.

* **Pricing and Greeks:**
    * **Bermudan Swaptions:** Prices using Longstaff-Schwartz (LSM) backward induction.
    * **Control Variates:** Uses analytical European swaption prices to reduce variance.
    * **Greeks:** Computes OIS Delta, EUR Delta, and Vega via pathwise bumping.

## Parameters
All model and simulation settings are located in src/config.py. 
You can modify::
* Simulation: SIM_PATHS (e.g., $2^{13}$), SIM_STEPS, RNG_TYPE ('sobol'/'standard').
* Physics: CORR_MODE ('pca', 'exp'), LMM_TENOR, RHO_OIS_EUR.
* Product: EXERCISE_DATES, STRIKE.

## Output
* Console: Valuation report including Bermudan price, European Control Variate adjustment, and Greeks (Delta/Vega).

* pics/: 3D plots of the Market vs. Model volatility surfaces and residual heatmaps (if CHECK_CALIBRATION = True in config).

* logs/: JSON files caching calibrated SABR parameters to speed up subsequent runs.
